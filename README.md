JS Challenge 9 

Exercise 9 from the 100+ Javascript projects page (https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/)

To add to the last project, i made it that when you click a store item it opens a image viewer, 
where you can click forward or backwards, took me 138 lines of code in Javascript, 
i learned new concepts by doing this project, which was hard to figure out, but i finally got the concept by looking at the source code given by the website (the 100 projects one)
